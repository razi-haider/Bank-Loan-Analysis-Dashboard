### Purpose of the Project
The main goal is to provide insights and actionable information to help the bank:
- Optimize loan issuance strategies
- Improve customer targeting and segmentation
- Enhance loan recovery rates
- Refine interest rate and DTI evaluation
- Tailor loan products based on customer needs and demographics

### Recommendations

#### 1. Loan Issuance Strategy
- **Focus on High-Grade Loans**: Given the higher growth in loans for grades A and B, prioritize high-grade loans to mitigate risk and enhance portfolio quality.
- **State-Specific Strategies**: Customize loan products and marketing efforts based on the state-wise distribution and performance of loans.

#### 2. Interest Rate and DTI Analysis
- **Adjust Interest Rates**: Evaluate interest rate structures to balance profitability and customer affordability, ensuring competitive rates that attract quality borrowers.
- **Monitor DTI Ratios**: Regularly assess DTI ratios to identify potential high-risk borrowers and adjust lending criteria accordingly.

#### 3. Loan Purpose Insights
- **Target Debt Consolidation**: With debt consolidation being the most common loan purpose, design targeted products and campaigns to address this segment effectively.
- **Diversify Loan Offerings**: Expand and tailor loan offerings for other purposes such as credit card refinancing, home improvement, and major purchases.

#### 4. Payment and Recovery Management
- **Enhance Recovery Efforts**: Strengthen recovery strategies for charged-off loans and improve the efficiency of collections processes to maximize recovered amounts.
- **Promote On-Time Payments**: Implement initiatives to encourage timely payments, such as reminder systems and incentives for early or on-time repayments.

#### 5. Geographic Targeting
- **Regional Focus**: Utilize geographic insights to prioritize regions with high customer concentrations and tailor marketing and loan products to meet regional demands.

### Visualizations
